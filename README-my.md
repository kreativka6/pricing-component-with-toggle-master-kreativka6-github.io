### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- Control the toggle with both their mouse/trackpad and their keyboard

## My process

  I used html5, css variables, flexbox and little javascript. Toogle checkbox was for me little challenge. Ternary operator was not working in my browser, 
  so I used older version of Javascript.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- very little Javascript
